## **DSML 3850**

This course explores cloud computing concepts, including virtualization, networking, security, serverless computing, and multi-tier application architectures. The projects in this repository involve hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure, automation, and deployment using tools such as Terraform and AWS.

## **Projects**

This repository contains various cloud computing projects completed for DSML3850, focusing on infrastructure provisioning, automation, and cloud-native application deployment. Below is an overview of the implemented projects:

- **Provisioning and Mounting EBS Volumes on AWS (Homework05):**  
  Implemented an automated Terraform configuration to provision an AWS Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume and attach it to an EC2 instance. The *setup.sh* script formats the volume, mounts it to the instance, and ensures persistence across reboots.

- **Flask Application Deployment on AWS EC2 (Activity09):**  
  Implemented an automated deployment script for provisioning an AWS EC2 instance and setting up a Flask web application. The script installs dependencies, configures system services, and ensures the application starts on boot using systemd.

- **Provisioning and Mounting EFS Volumes on AWS (Homework06):**
Implemented an automated Terraform configuration to provision an AWS Elastic File System (EFS) and mount it to multiple EC2 instances. The project explores file-system storage virtualization and demonstrates how to configure persistent, scalable cloud storage.

- **Web Application Deployment on AWS (Activity13):**  
Designed and deployed a 3-tier AWS cloud architecture with class, integrating a PostgreSQL database, Flask web application, and Docker containerization. The project focuses on infrastructure automation, containerized deployment, and cloud security best practices.
